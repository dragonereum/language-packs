By the way, anyone can apply, but there's no certainty that the battle planner will choose you. But if there's nothing for your dragon to do, you can plan your own battle!",

What did you think? The public wants a good show! And your dragon will stay with us until he's worked off the battle. Running around the Arena comes later. If he wins, of course.",
      "chooseAnOpponent": "And don't forget to choose an opponent. If you don't choose one yourself, we'll send some random thug of a dragon into battle against yours. But you can always cut a deal - just pay a small amount to extend the time until the battle begins. Your chances of finding a good opponent will improve. But don't make the crowd wait too long, okay? You need to leave time for betting too. When the time runs out, either you or your opponent can start the battle. The rules of combat are just the same as they are in the Arena. The winner will end up a lot richer, the loser a lot poorer. But, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained!",

This can happen if the enemy's Defense is higher than my dragon's Attack. In ranged combat the enemy can't counterattack, but Astor doesn't deal as much damage. So proper preparation means studying your opponent carefully.",
      "managedDragons": "And I think that's all I've managed to learn about the dragons' skills and how they use them in combat. Now that I've studied their fighting traditions in detail, I can send Astor into battle and expect him to win every time. Now where's that Arena..."

      "staringAtHim": "No, you're just staring at him! What a stubborn dragon! He won't fight until he gets his Ether. The greedy little sneak! How did he get into all those fights before? Hold on! It looks like some big bruiser is already picking a fight with Astor...",
      "attackedAlready": "My dragon's attacked been already! I couldn't even give Astor a suitable Attack Strategy - you can't do it unless you attack first. The defending dragon uses the Defense Strategy it was given beforehand. Dragons may be proud creatures, but they're also obedient. Let's hope my strategy for Astor works out. Now all I can do is wait and see how the battle goes. Come on, Astor!"

      "butICanDoSomeAttacking": "But I can do some attacking of my own. Astor may have been beaten, but his spirit hasn't been broken! But first I'd better give him a chance to lick his wounds and get his strength back. Wounded dragons make pretty lousy fighters."

One surprising thing is that my dragon earned something called \"Experience Points\" for winning. I wonder what they're for.",
      "iGetItNow": "Oh, I think I get it now. Dragons earn Experience Points when they win battles. As they earn experience, they get closer to leveling up and learning new abilities. The stronger the enemy they defeat, the more experience they earn. The losing dragon probably doesn't get anything. I hope Astor reaches level 2 soon - I can't wait to see what else these amazing creatures can do!",
      "byTheWay": "By the way, the winner gets less experience if he's defending. But the attacking dragon doesn't just earn experience - he also earns gold for his master! And, as I pointed out earlier, you can't get an egg to hatch into a dragon without gold."

      "dnaPoints": "Okay, DNA Points can be spent in two ways: to improve the dragon's skills, or to obtain offspring. The number of DNA Points you get increases with each new level, but the upgrades cost more, too. Judging by the other dragons, the highest level Astor can reach would be level 10.",
      "iThoughtThat": "I thought that all of his skills would be improved at once, but apparently there's more to it than that. Each part of a dragon's body - head, torso, and paws - makes its own contribution to the dragon's overall skill level. And each body part affect its own set of indicators. You can use DNA Points to upgrade your dragon's paws, which will increase the level of the corresponding skills. Okay, Astor, let's take a look at your anatomy...",
      "completelyForgot": "Oh, I completely forgot about the second option. You can also use DNA Points to get your dragon to produce offspring. Dragons are basically asexual - any two individuals can produce a new dragon egg. I seem to have discovered the answer to the question of how new dragons will keep appearing even once the ancestral eggs in the Genesis volcano have all been used up...",
      "holdOnASecond": "Hold on a second - in Genesis, a Fire Egg hatches into a Fire Dragon. So what kind of egg will we get if we match two dragons of different breeds? I guess the baby will probably have body parts from both parents. And its offspring will be even more varied. I really can't wait to try it! But that means I'm going to have to train a second dragon. Shoot, how am I supposed to do that? There are obviously no other users here, and there's no Marketplace to exchange eggs and dragons either. You know, for Ether or gold.",

Unlike the purebred dragons in Genesis, most of the eggs and dragons at the Marketplace will have been bred by users. This opens up so many possibilities! First of all, once there are no more Genesis eggs left we'll be able to buy new ones at the Marketplace. Second, you won't necessarily need to train two dragons if you want to get a baby dragon - you'll be able to buy what you need from other Masters.",

But breeding two close relatives can lead to problems. A baby born to two dragons who are offspring of the same parent may have birth defects, which will have a negative impact on its skills. And, however successful you are at training your dragons, you're still going to need fresh blood for breeding. That's why I'm so eager for new Masters to come to Dragonereum. Then we'll be able to combine our efforts. I assume we'll be able to make arrangements at the Marketplace.",
      "withTrading": "As with trading, Masters will be able to offer their dragons as breeding stock in return for gold or Ether. Once the deal is done, the purchaser will get a new dragon egg and the seller will receive the price they had set. After all, it won't be possible to spend DNA Points to upgrade your dragons' skills or breed them any longer.",
      "turnsOut": "As it turns out, picking the right breeding pair is a real art, and there are no firm rules. A strong dragon will have strong offspring, and a fast dragon will have fast offspring.
