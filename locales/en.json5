You need to leave time for betting too. When the time runs out, either you or your opponent can start the battle. The rules of combat are just the same as they are in the Arena.

      "astorProud": "Astor isn't just proud, he's aggressive too. He's always getting into fights with other dragons. But the dragons always love a good battle. They've even cleared a special Arena. And the losing dragon always gets a chance to catch its breath and heal up. Could it be a kind of play, a way for them to hone skills of some sort? I need to observe their battles closely."

The main factor here is, of course, Speed. A quick fighter can land several blows before his opponent catches up. He also strikes first. Combat is extremely intense and lasts until one of the fighters runs out of Health.",

They're much more powerful than ordinary Attack and Defense, and they're different for each breed of dragon. But the dragons don't use their Special Moves all the time because they require too much energy. I call this energy \"Mana.\"",

I think there's more to this than just how much Mana they have.",

I'm trying to determine Astor's definitive battle strategy while balancing these different questions.",
      "meleeAttacks": "It isn't easy. On the one hand, dragons do more damage with melee attacks. But attacking from close up gives the enemy a chance to counterattack. This can happen if the enemy's Defense is higher than my dragon's Attack. In ranged combat the enemy can't counterattack, but Astor doesn't deal as much damage. So proper preparation means studying your opponent carefully.",

      "attackedAlready": "My dragon's attacked been already! I couldn't even give Astor a suitable Attack Strategy - you can't do it unless you attack first. The defending dragon uses the Defense Strategy it was given beforehand. Dragons may be proud creatures, but they're also obedient. Let's hope my strategy for Astor works out.

      "iGetItNow": "Oh, I think I get it now. Dragons earn Experience Points when they win battles. As they earn experience, they get closer to leveling up and learning new abilities. The stronger the enemy they defeat, the more experience they earn. The losing dragon probably doesn't get anything. I hope Astor reaches level 2 soon - I can't wait to see what else these amazing creatures can do!",

      "dnaPoints": "Okay, DNA Points can be spent in two ways: to improve the dragon's skills, or to obtain offspring. The number of DNA Points you get increases with each new level, but the upgrades cost more, too. Judging by the other dragons, the highest level Astor can reach would be level 10.",
      "iThoughtThat": "I thought that all of his skills would be improved at once, but apparently there's more to it than that. Each part of a dragon's body - head, torso, and paws - makes its own contribution to the dragon's overall skill level. And each body part affect its own set of indicators. You can use DNA Points to upgrade your dragon's paws, which will increase the level of the corresponding skills. Okay, Astor, let's take a look at your anatomy...",
      "completelyForgot": "Oh, I completely forgot about the second option. You can also use DNA Points to get your dragon to produce offspring.

I guess the baby will probably have body parts from both parents. And its offspring will be even more varied. I really can't wait to try it! But that means I'm going to have to train a second dragon.

But breeding two close relatives can lead to problems. A baby born to two dragons who are offspring of the same parent may have birth defects, which will have a negative impact on its skills. And, however successful you are at training your dragons, you're still going to need fresh blood for breeding. That's why I'm so eager for new Masters to come to Dragonereum. Then we'll be able to combine our efforts. I assume we'll be able to make arrangements at the Marketplace.",
